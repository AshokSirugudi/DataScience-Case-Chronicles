# DataScience-Case-Chronicles

A curated portfolio of data science case studies driven by mathematical reasoning. This repository showcases your ability to explore, question, and derive insights using deep statistical and mathematical understanding.

**What**: Math-driven, insight-first data science projects.  
**Why**: To showcase deep reasoning, statistical exploration, and structured problem solving.  
**Where**: Covers EDA, probability, hypothesis testing, and mathematical techniques.  
**Which**: Ideal for problems where storytelling, interpretability, and insight extraction matter.  
**How**: Start from a mathematical idea ‚Üí apply it to real-world data ‚Üí extract insights.

## üîç Objective
